Running Descanso
---------------

Add the descanso app to your Django project
Create an app with your own models and add an api.py file

In the api.py file, add the following lines:
    import descanso
    api = descanso.api()

You can now import your models and register them in api.py:
    from models import ModelA, ModelB
    api.register(ModelA)
    api.register(ModelB)

You can also use api.py as the url file for your api, just add:
    urlpatterns = api.urlpatterns()

Configure your project's urls:

    urlpatterns +=  patterns('', (r'^api/', include('demo.api')) )
